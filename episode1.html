<div id = "ex"><b>Exhibit A: RAGINI LASKAR:</b> 
<p>The annoyingly misandric roommate of his friend Sakshi. 
It was 12 on a sweltering afternoon and this poor maiden's bicycle had just broken down. Nisarg was chilling with his two friends, Sakshi and Akshat, in front of MT hall at this time. Ragini (roller), in distress, approached the group for some help and it isn't hard to guess who volunteered to provide help. That's right, our very own king of kindness, Nissu Yaya. But guess what, instead of helping her right away, he volunteered to go with her at 4pm to the cycle shop. We couldn't help but read into the situation. What led this helpful man to postpone "helping" this damsel in distress? Was it the presence of Akshat and Sakshi? Did he need some alone time with her?
</p><p>Also, when the group of friends meet again at 7pm, Nisarg just conveniently forgets the details of his little trip to the cycle shop but Sakshi had already found out from her roommate, Ragini that after he helped her in fixing her cycle, he took her on a tour of the campus and also bought her a burger. And we are talking about a guy who doesn't even buy his friends 20 rupees worth of ice cream. Did those details really slip out of his mind or did he just conveniently forget about them? Who will ever know?
