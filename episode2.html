<p>
Look at this person, a person who claims to help all his friends in their adversities. But we have reasons to believe that he only does so under false pretenses. When there is absolutely no way of butting out on his friends, he helps them. But even if he finds a single excuse to butt out, he does so. We have many examples illustrating this fact. Firstly, a week before semester 1 End Sem exams, his friends asked him if he wanted to spend 30 mins in their company. But the guy says that "Exams are approaching and I need to sleep". And his friends appreciate the fact that he is so sincere towards his studies. Fast forwarding a few months---mid sem exams of sem 2 ----- ARE GOING ON!! And when Ananya Kalsotra asks for his assistance in studies, the motherfucker comes voluntarily to the library and "teaches" her till 4am. On the very next day, when his other friends, Sid and Tarun, who had the misfortune of missing a few (read: a lot of) lectures, approach Nissu for his help, he outright denies them. After they plead for a bit, he gives them barely any time as compared to the hours he spent "teaching" ananya kalsotra. On what criteria does this kind and helpful person choose the people who deserve his help??!!.

<p>Again, fast forwarding a few weeks, in this unpredictable pandemic situation, the university resorts to conducting online labs and lectures. Guess who helps Ananya Kalsotra in completing all her PDS assignments which despite Nissu’s “teaching”, is incompetant to do so herself? So, Nissu, being her knight in shining armour, steps forward to rescue the pretty maiden from the lower grade she deserves and does all the assignments. And guess what nissu gains from it? A treat (read: date) in Chai Break with her. Was this his intention all along? Also, in PDS Lab tests, when Nisarg's springfest colleagues pressurize him to help them, he is given the choice between helping two people, Ankita and Yashraj. And you will never be able to guess what he does. Of course, he chooses Ankita and gives the other’s responsibility to Akshat. Here again, nisarg decides that a GIRL deserves his help more. But only a few days later, when it's his turn to help his friends in the Physics lab exam, he butts out on them for his own convenience. And after that, he vehemently apologises. Akshat and Kaushal fall prey to his pretty words but Sakshi, who has been wronged by him many times, sees right through him. Now it is up to you readers to decide what possesses nissu to offer his help to SOME people but abandon others in dire need.
