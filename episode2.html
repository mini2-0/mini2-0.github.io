<p>
</p>
<p>Again, fast forwarding a few weeks, in this unpredictable pandemic situation, the university resorts to conducting online labs and lectures. Guess who helps Ananya Kalsotra in completing all her PDS assignments which despite Nissu�s �teaching�, is incompetant to do so herself? So, Nissu, being her knight in shining armour, steps forward to rescue the pretty maiden from the lower grade she deserves and does all the assignments. And guess what nissu gains from it? A treat (read: date) in Chai Break with her. Was this his intention all along? Also, in PDS Lab tests, when Nisarg�s springfest colleagues pressurize him to help them, he is given the choice between helping two people, Ankita and Yashraj. And you will never be able to guess what he does. Of course, he chooses Ankita and gives the other�s responsibility to Akshat. Here again, nisarg decides that a GIRL deserves his help more. But only a few days later, when it's his turn to help his friends in the Physics lab exam, he butts out on them for his own convenience. And after that, he vehemently apologises. Akshat and Kaushal fall prey to his pretty words but Sakshi, who has been wronged by him many times, sees right through him. Now it is up to you readers to decide what possesses nissu to offer his help to SOME people but abandon others in dire need.
